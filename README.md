Python API for MATSim
=====================

This is a Python API to interact with the MATSim Software.
It is mostly meant for teaching MATSim to non-programmers without loosing too much
of the ability to configure, modify and analyse MATSim runs.

Roadmap
-------

This is a wish-list of what should be there by Fall 2019:

* [ ] Fast (enough) event handling
* [ ] Fast (enough) data manipulation
* [ ] Good enough IDE support for scenario and config
* [ ] Deploy to PyPi and conda-forge
